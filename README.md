SICSS-Korea 2024 Team Project

## Datasets
Datasets for this project are saved in `data`, where preprocessed data is located in its `clean` subdirectory. However, as the city temperature __raw__ dataset is larger than 100MB, this repository does not include the file. Kindly download the raw dataset at [this Kaggle dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhamjain/temperature-of-all-countries-19952020) and save it as `city-temperature.csv` in the `data` directory.
